    방향은 잡지 못했으나 개발자 희망하는 사람. 견습 개발자<br>
    <p id=song>You don't want to hurt me
    Why you want me to know?
    You loved me
    And now you don't anymore
    Is there no way out?
    Is there no way out?
    Is there no way out now?
    And it's hard to know
    Is there no way out?
    Life's short
    Why does it take so long?
    We're only here once
    Why blame yourself?
    We don't want the same things
    But we're afraid to let go
    Is there no way out?
    Is there no way out?
    Is there no way out now?
    And it's hard to know
    Is there no way out?
    Life's short
    Why does it take so long?
    We're only here once
    Blame someone
    If life's short
    Why does it take so long?
    We're only here once
    Why blame yourself?</p>
